# Congruity/MHGUI Fork
This fork of the excellent [Congruity/MHGUI](https://github.com/congruity/congruity) software by Scott Talbert *et al.* adds the following features:
* **GIRR Pronto Code Import for MHGUI**: Import multiple functions or even a whole device into your Harmony remote from a GIRR file.
* **Win32 Installer**: Easily install and run Congruity or MHGUI on your Windows PC by running our setup program. It installs Congruity, MHGUI, and all dependencies (Python, packages, Concordance libraries, etc.) automatically and in a self-contained manner.
    * For devs: See [my fork](https://github.com/Ben-Meister/concordance) or the pull request for my changes made to the excellent [Concordance](https://github.com/jaymzh/concordance) software by Phil Dibowitz et al.
* **Numerous bugfixes and usability improvements.**

Everything has been submitted upstream as pull requests.
